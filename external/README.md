### External directory

## Sdsl
The sdsl library allows us to work with very big data by implementing succinct data structures.<br>
## Lest
Lest is the library we use for units tests
## BM
the bit-magic library is another implementation of succinct data structure.<br>

subdirectory element of the ConwayBromage library.
